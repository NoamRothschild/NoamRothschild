  <summary>(Assembly) A Simple Discord Clone 💬</summary>

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fe0669e-3157-4e75-a6a7-f573bbfc1d34)

  **A recap of the things done in the project:**
  - Re-Implemented the SHA1 && Base64 protocols (based on their corresponding RFC's)
  - Created a simple HTTP library for parsing and generating messages
  - Implemented proper handling of websockets to allow for full-duplex communication
   
  - Created my own standart library including, but not all:
  -  [x] string utilities
  -  [x] file handling interrupt wrappers
  -  [x] threading interrupt wrappers (including shared memory)
  -  [x] time formatters
  -  [x] socket creation and handling
  -  [x] simple database for storing user data (2 distinct types)

 And at the tip of the iceberg: **Merged them all to create a Discord clone**
 
 After compiling the x86 nasm code and executing it, you can access the website on `localhost:8000` (you can allow the whole network to reach it with proper handling && nginx configured)

 The site allows multiple users (after authenticating) to communicate with each other on 4 distinct channels in real time

   This is my attempt in contributing to the beloved community of the open source game "Pokemon Infinite Fusion" by writing a way for players to play together!

   This project has had several rewrites, the [readme](https://github.com/NoamRothschild/infinitefusion-multiplayer/blob/main/readme.md) in the oldest version should cover all data about the project, but the source of it is inside a new repository.

   This project enables players to connect to a *redis* database and uses their pub-sub protocol to exchange data between clients, like player location, skin, and even trade items!

  Initially made in order to automate an entrance exam in my school

  - parses the given string inputs into smart and compact structures that are blazingly fast to interpret.
  - provides a REPL for experimenting with instructions, along with a CLI
